# The quantum internet and quantum computers: how will they change the world?

- The quantum internet is now in a similar stage as the classical internet in the 1960's. In half a decade
the internet gained a huge role in our daily life.

- A quantum internet enables us to send qubits from one node to another. This allows us to create entanglement between any two points.

- Entanglement is inherently private.

## Qubit

A qubit is an essential element in quantum computing and quantum internet. It is a unit of quantum information,
and the quantum counterpart of the classical bit.

It is not possible to copy qubits.

## Superposition

Every quantum state can be seen as a linear combination, a sum of other distinct quantum states.

- Quantum computers are good at solving search tasks.

## Entanglement

- Quantum entanglement is a special connection between two qubits. When entangled, they can be moved
arbitrarily far apart from each other and remain entangled.

- When measured, entangled qubits will always yield zero or one perfectly at random, but they will
always yield the same outcome.

### Properties

1. Inherently private
2. Maximal coordination

## Teleportation

- Quantum teleportation is a method to send qubits using entanglement.

- Quantum teleportation can transmit a qubit without really using a physical carrier.

- It does not allow for faster than light communication.

## Quantum computer requirements

1. A quantum computer must be scalable.
2. It must be possible to initialise the qubits.
3. Good qubits are needed, the quantum state cannot be lost.
4. We need to have a universal set of quantum gates.
5. We need to be able to measure all qubits.

A billion qubits alone does not make a quantum computer. In order to do something practial with these qubits, we need to be able to control and read them, and all these qubits need to work in harmony according to your input.

## Quantum internet

- Composed of end nodes, switches, repeaters and control traffic.
- An entangled state between two qubits is the essence of the power of a quantum internet.
- Maximum coordination - qubits can be entangled at a very long distance, but when we make the same measurement on both qubits, they will give the same outcome.
- Inherently private - when two qubits are maximally entangled, it is impossible for any other qubit to have a share of this entanglement.
- More than two qubits can be entangled, but two qubits that are maximally entangled can not be entangled with other qubits. (?)

## Securing your data

### Factoring

- There is a great asymmetry in multiplying and factoring: multiplying is easy, factoring is complicated.
- This asymmetry is used in cryptography.
- Shor's quantum factoring algorithm: an algorithm which makes factoring possible in reasonable time, something that is not possible on a classical computer.

### Secure communication

- One of the applications of a quantum internet is secure communication. Specifically, a quantum internet allows us to realize quantum key distribution. 
- Practical cryptographic systems that are used in the real world nowadays use keys that are much shorter than the message. So they don't offer the ultimate guarantees of security. 
- Qubits cannot be copied, and this is at the heart of quantum key distribution, which always allows us to make more key to secure communication.
