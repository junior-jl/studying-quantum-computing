# The quantum internet and quantum computers: how will they change the world?

- The quantum internet is now in a similar stage as the classical internet in the 1960's. In half a decade
the internet gained a huge role in our daily life.

- A quantum internet enables us to send qubits from one node to another. This allows us to create entanglement between any two points.

- Entanglement is inherently private.

## Qubit

A qubit is an essential element in quantum computing and quantum internet. It is a unit of quantum information,
and the quantum counterpart of the classical bit.

It is not possible to copy qubits.

## Superposition

Every quantum state can be seen as a linear combination, a sum of other distinct quantum states.

- Quantum computers are good at solving search tasks.

## Entanglement

- Quantum entanglement is a special connection between two qubits. When entangled, they can be moved
arbitrarily far apart from each other and remain entangled.

- When measured, entangled qubits will always yield zero or one perfectly at random, but they will
always yield the same outcome.

### Properties

1. Inherently private
2. Maximal coordination

## Teleportation

- Quantum teleportation is a method to send qubits using entanglement.

- Quantum teleportation can transmit a qubit without really using a physical carrier.

- It does not allow for faster than light communication.
