# Superdense coding redux: putting it all together

The superdense coding algorithm studied before can be summarized as:

1. Eve prepares the Bell state $\ket{B_{00}}$;
2. Eve sends one qubit to Alice and one qubit to Bob;
3. Alice applies I, X, Z or XZ to her qubit depending on which two bits
she wants to communicate to Bob -> Bell state;
4. Alice sends her qubit to Bob;
5. Bob distinguish which of the four states.
