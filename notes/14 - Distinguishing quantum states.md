# Distinguishing quantum states

If you have orthonormal quantum states, they can always be distinguished.

This is another essential attribute of the Bell states, they are orthonormal
to one another.


## Measurement in an orthonormal basis

In computational basis, if we had

$$ \ket{\psi} = \sum_j = \alpha_j \ket{j} $$

we would get the result of the measure as: j, with prob. $|\alpha|^2$,
and the posterior state would be $\ket{j}$.

In an arbitrary orthonormal $\ket{\psi_j}$ basis

$$ \ket{\psi} = \sum_j \alpha_j \ket{\psi_j} $$

the output would be: j, with prob. $|\alpha|^2$, but the posterior state
would be $\ket{\psi_j}$.
