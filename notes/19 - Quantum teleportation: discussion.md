# Quantum teleportation

In the quantum teleportation protocol, note that:

- Alice didn't know anything about the initial state of her qubit.
- Curiously, the Bell basis measurement doesn't say a thing about the initial state of the quantum bit.
- Because of the measurement, we know that we are not creating a copy of the initial state of Alice's qubit
on Bob's qubit, we are destroying the initial state and recovering it in Bob's qubit.

The quantum teleportation must be interpreted as a basic primitive operation
that can be used to do all sorts of other things, like quantum error correction,
quantum computation, architectures, etc.
